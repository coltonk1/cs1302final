## Part 1.1: App Description

    This app allows the user to search for many plants using either
    a common name, or for more specific searches allows for use
    of the scientific name. The results will show a small
    Wikipedia entry and also more specific data about the plant.
    The data includes the first publication of the plant, and
    can even include where it is distributed natively.

## Part 1.2: APIs

### API 1

```
https://trefle.io/api/v1/plants/search?token=YOUR_TREFLE_TOKEN&q=coconut
https://trefle.io/api/v1/plants/{id}?token=YOUR_TREFLE_TOKEN
```

    This API does include a token.

### API 2

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&redirects=true&format=json&prop=extracts&exintro=true&titles=Senecio%20gamolepis
```

## Part 2: New

I was excited to learn more about working with unique APIs. I enjoyed
    using them to acomplish a goal that utilized both APIs in one.
    I was able to learn to map data better.

## Part 3: Retrospect

If I could go back and restart, I would probably try to plan
    what the design of the app would look like better. With
    this project, I eventually came to a design I was happy
    with, but I could have saved much more time had I thought
    about the design before I began.
